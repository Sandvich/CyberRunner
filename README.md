# CyberRunner

A simple runner game written in [DOME](https://github.com/avivbeeri/dome). Very early in development.

## Installation
You will need the `dome` executable in order to run the game. If, like me, you are using Mac OS, you can simply clone the repo and use the binary included in the repo. Otherwise, you will need to fetch a binary appropriate for your system from [here](https://github.com/avivbeeri/dome/releases).

You will need SDL2 if you are using MacOS or Linux.  
On Mac you can run:
```brew install sdl2```
For Linux, consult your distro documentation.  
If you're running Windows, the SDL library is bundled with the dome executable, so you don't need to do anything.
